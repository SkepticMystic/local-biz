## TODOs

- [ ] PWA on app store: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable#installation_from_an_app_store
- [ ] Zero sync? (local-first :yum:)
- [ ] Proper site.manifest and favicons: https://realfavicongenerator.net
- [ ] Seller profiles. Similar to how we ensure_org_exists on business creation, we can have a profile for each seller. This will be separate to the account stuff, and can capture public facing info about the biz owner
- [ ] Cloudinary image stuff, copied from animal-shelter
- [ ] A rating/thumbs-up system
- [ ] Contact form
- [ ] Implement carta markdown editor. We can view markdown, but currently only edit it in a Textarea
