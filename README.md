## Outreach

### Sellers

> Hey {{name}}
>
> I want to introduce you to Local First, a site I'm building to help local-owned businesses in Hermanus.
>
> The site is a directory aimed at making it easier for customers to find **local** businesses, and for owners to promote themselves. Listings can only be added by owners who live in the area the business serves. That way, customers know they're supporting their community.
>
> Another benefit is having a dedicated page for your business. I often see people on community groups asking for recommendations, but there are often restrictions on advertising. Local First is a dedicated space to list & find recommendations. Customers that want to recommend you, can simply share your Local First listing.
